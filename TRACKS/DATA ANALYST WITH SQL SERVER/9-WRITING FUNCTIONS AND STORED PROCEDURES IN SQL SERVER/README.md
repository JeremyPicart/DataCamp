# Course Description

Take your SQL Server programming to the next level. First, we demystify how to manipulate datetime data by performing temporal exploratory data analysis with the Washington DC BikeShare transactional dataset. Then, you’ll master how to create, update, and execute user-defined functions and stored procedures. You will learn the proper context for each modular programming tool and best practices. In the final chapter, you will apply all of your new skills to solve a real-world business case identifying the New York City yellow taxi utilization for each borough, and which pickup locations should be scheduled for each driver shift.

* 9.1 Learn how to do effective exploratory data analysis on temporal data, create scalar and table variables to store data, and learn how to execute date manipulation. This chapter will also cover the following SQL functions: DATEDIFF( ), DATENAME( ), DATEPART( ), CAST( ), CONVERT( ), GETDATE( ), and DATEADD( ).

* 9.2 This chapter will explain how to create, update, and execute user-defined functions (UDFs). You will learn about the various types of UDFs: scalar, inline, and multi-statement table-valued. You’ll also learn best practices.

* 9.3 Learn how to create, update, and execute stored procedures. Investigate the differences between stored procedures and user defined functions, including appropriate scenarios for each.

* 9.4 Apply your new skills in temporal EDA, user-defined functions, and stored procedures to solve a business case problem. Analyze the New York City taxi ride dataset to identify average fare per distance, ride count, and total ride time for each borough on each day of the week. And which pickup locations within the borough should be scheduled for each driver shift?
