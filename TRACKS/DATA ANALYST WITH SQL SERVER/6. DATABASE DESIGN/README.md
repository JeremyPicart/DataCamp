# Course Description

A good database design is crucial for a high-performance application. Just like you wouldn't start building a house without the benefit of a blueprint, you need to think about how your data will be stored beforehand. Taking the time to design a database saves time and frustration later on, and a well-designed database ensures ease of access and retrieval of information. While choosing a design, a lot of considerations have to be accounted for. In this course, you'll learn how to process, store, and organize data in an efficient way. You'll see how to structure data through normalization and present your data with views. Finally, you'll learn how to manage your database and all of this will be done on a variety of datasets from book sales, car rentals, to music reviews.

* 6.1 Start your journey into database design by learning about the two approaches to data processing, OLTP and OLAP. In this first chapter, you'll also get familiar with the different forms data can be stored in and learn the basics of data modeling.

* 6.2 In this chapter, you will take your data modeling skills to the next level. You'll learn to implement star and snowflake schemas, recognize the importance of normalization and see how to normalize databases to different extents.

* 6.3 Get ready to work with views! In this chapter, you will learn how to create and query views. On top of that, you'll master more advanced capabilities to manage them and end by identifying the difference between materialized and non-materialized views.

* 6.4 This final chapter ends with some database management-related topics. You will learn how to grant database access based on user roles, how to partition tables into smaller pieces, what to keep in mind when integrating data, and which DBMS fits your business needs best.
