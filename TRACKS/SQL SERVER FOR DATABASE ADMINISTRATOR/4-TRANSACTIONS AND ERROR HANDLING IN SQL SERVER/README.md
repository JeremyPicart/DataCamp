# Course Description

It is critical to know how to handle errors and manage transactions when programming SQL scripts. Unhandled errors can be very harmful and can cause unexpected situations, such as inconsistent data in your database, or even worse, errors can lead you to make wrong business decisions. In this course, you will learn how to handle errors and discover how to manage transactions in case of an error. Additionally, you will study what happens when two or more people interact at the same time with the same data. You will practice all these concepts using two datasets, one of them based on bank accounts and the other one on an electric bike store.

* 4.1 To begin the course, you will learn how to handle errors using the TRY...CATCH construct that provides T-SQL. You will study the anatomy of errors, and you will learn how to use some functions that can give you information about errors.

* 4.2 In this chapter, you will deepen your knowledge of handling errors. You will learn how to raise errors using RAISERROR and THROW. Additionally, you will discover how to customize errors.

* 4.3 In this chapter, you will be introduced to the concept of transactions. You will discover how to commit and rollback them. You will finish by learning how to return the number of transactions and their state.

* 4.4 This chapter defines what concurrency is and how it can affect transactions. You will learn exciting concepts like dirty reads, repeatable reads, and phantom reads. To avoid or allow this reads, you will explore, one by one, the different transaction isolation levels.
