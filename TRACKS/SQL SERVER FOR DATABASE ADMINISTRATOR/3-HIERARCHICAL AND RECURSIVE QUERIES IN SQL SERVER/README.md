# Course Description

Do you want to query complex data structures in an iterative way? Do you have access to hierarchical data structures that need to be queried? This course will teach you the tools required to solve these questions. You will learn how to write recursive queries and query hierarchical data structures. To do this, you will use Common Table Expressions (CTE) and the recursion principle on a wide variety of datasets. You will, for example, dig into a flight plan dataset and learn how to find the best and cheapest connection between two airports. After completing this course, you will understand the principle of recursion, and be able to identify and create hierarchical data models.

* 3.1 In this chapter, you will learn about recursion and why it is beneficial to apply this technique. You will also refresh your knowledge about Common Expression Tables (CTE).

* 3.2 In this chapter, you will learn about recursive CTEs, how to query hierarchical datasets, and finally, how to apply recursive CTEs on hierarchical data.

* 3.3 In this chapter, you will learn how to create and modify database tables. You will learn about relational and hierarchical data models, how they differ, and when each model should be used.

* 3.4 In this chapter, you will practice your learnings about hierarchical and recursive querying on real-world problems, such as finding possible flight routes, assembling a car, and modeling a power grid.
