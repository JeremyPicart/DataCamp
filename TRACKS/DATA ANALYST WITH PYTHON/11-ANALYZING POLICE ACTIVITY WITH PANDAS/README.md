# Course Description

Now that you have learned the foundations of pandas, this course will give you the chance to apply that knowledge by answering interesting questions about a real dataset! You will explore the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset and analyze the impact of gender on police behavior. During the course, you will gain more practice cleaning messy data, creating visualizations, combining and reshaping datasets, and manipulating time series data. Analyzing Police Activity with pandas will give you valuable experience analyzing a dataset from start to finish, preparing you for your data science career!

* 11.1 Before beginning your analysis, it is critical that you first examine and clean the dataset, to make working with it a more efficient process. In this chapter, you will practice fixing data types, handling missing values, and dropping columns and rows while learning about the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset.

* 11.2 Does the gender of a driver have an impact on police behavior during a traffic stop? In this chapter, you will explore that question while practicing filtering, grouping, method chaining, Boolean math, string methods, and more!

* 11.3 Are you more likely to get arrested at a certain time of day? Are drug-related stops on the rise? In this chapter, you will answer these and other questions by analyzing the dataset visually, since plots can help you to understand trends in a way that examining the raw data cannot.

* 11.4 In this chapter, you will use a second dataset to explore the impact of weather conditions on police behavior during traffic stops. You will practice merging and reshaping datasets, assessing whether a data source is trustworthy, working with categorical data, and other advanced skills.
