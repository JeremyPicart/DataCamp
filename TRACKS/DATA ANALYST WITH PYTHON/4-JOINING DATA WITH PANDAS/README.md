# Course Description

Being able to combine and work with multiple datasets is an essential skill for any aspiring Data Scientist. Pandas is a crucial cornerstone of the Python data science ecosystem, with Stack Overflow recording 5 million views for pandas questions. Learn to handle multiple DataFrames by combining, organizing, joining, and reshaping them using pandas. You'll work with datasets from the World Bank and the City Of Chicago. You will finish the course with a solid skillset for data-joining in pandas.

* 4.1 Learn how you can merge disparate data using inner joins. By combining information from multiple sources you’ll uncover compelling insights that may have previously been hidden. You’ll also learn how the relationship between those sources, such as one-to-one or one-to-many, can affect your result.

* 4.2 Take your knowledge of joins to the next level. In this chapter, you’ll work with TMDb movie data as you learn about left, right, and outer joins. You’ll also discover how to merge a table to itself and merge on a DataFrame index.

* 4.3 In this chapter, you’ll leverage powerful filtering techniques, including semi-joins and anti-joins. You’ll also learn how to glue DataFrames by vertically combining and using the pandas.concat function to create new datasets. Finally, because data is rarely clean, you’ll also learn how to validate your newly combined data structures.

* 4.4 In this final chapter, you’ll step up a gear and learn to apply pandas' specialized methods for merging time-series and ordered data together with real-world financial and economic data from the city of Chicago. You’ll also learn how to query resulting tables using a SQL-style format, and unpivot data using the melt method.
